# Mandelbrot-Set-Exploration-in-Python

the desc of this repo lies btw

i hate python so i tried remaking a program i did in c# 9 years ago, in python. this shit repo just proves 14 year old me in c# did better than python does now, lol

if you want to run this monstrosity just clone the git and make sure u got the VS Build tool. then pip install -r requirements.txt unless youre a nerd who likes molesting their hard drive

you also need to compile the cython proj, use mingw if ur cool otherwise 
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
works

now you can run any script in the dir voila! python sucks
